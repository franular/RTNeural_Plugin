# Tensorflow Wavetable Lookup MLP Model

This is kind of a silly example. There are better ways to make a variable oscillator. But it is a proof of concept that this works.

RTNeural is designed to run inference on Tensorflow/Keras models. Thus, once trained and saved as a json file, this model can be loaded directly into RTNeural

### Running the training

As with most of these trainings, it is best to create a virtual environment in the 'RTNeural/python' directory and run the training from there.

**From the terminal:**

1. make sure you are in the RTNeural/python directory
2. see the RTNeural/python/Readme.md file for setting up a virtual environment in the root directory

**3. run the training**
> python 4Osc_MLP_keras/train_mlp_4Osc_tf.py
